# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Monty Bytecode Interpreter. This is a C program that will take a file as an argument, open the file, and read the instructions in the file, line by line. For each line read, the interpreter is supposed to execute the instructions on that line.

## The primary difference between Stack and Queue Data Structures is that Stack follows LIFO while Queue follows FIFO data structure type. LIFO refers to Last In First Out. It means that when we put data in a Stack, it processes the last entry first. Conversely, FIFO refers to First In First Out.
